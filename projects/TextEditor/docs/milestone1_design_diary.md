# Design Diary
Use this space to talk about your process.  For inspiration, see [my prompts](../../../docs/sample_reflection.md) 

My process began with 400 some odd errors that seemed completely unfixable until it accidentally fixed itself a few days before our check in. I still don't really know what caused the problems, but after pushing from my laptop and pulling back onto my PC, everything magically fell into place.

After I was able to run the lab code on my machine, I began taking inspiration from multiple different text editors such as Nano, VIMS,and Emacs and worked to impliment different pieces of each that I liked to make my own Text Editor GUI. Once I had a basic layout, I started to look into basic commands to add color to the text and background, and ended up with a mess of colors covering all previously made pieces of my GUI.

While nothing currently does anything, I feel this is a nice layout for what's to come in the future, and am excited to move forward with this project and see how everything evolves over time.
